spacebrew-synth
===============

Additive synth built in processing using the Beads library and controlled with the phone's accelerometer over space brew.

- Run the Processing sketch
- In your phone browser navigate to: http://labatrockwell.github.io/spacebrew-javascript-wildstyle-examples/spacebrew_phones/index.html?server=sandbox.spacebrew.cc&name=testPhone
- Give your phone a name for easy identification: change name=testPhone to name=anyNameYouWant
- In your desktop browser navigate to: http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/
- Connect the accelerometer / gyro "publishers" to the sketch's "subscribers"
- Rotate your phone to change the frequencies of the different waveform generators
- Listen. Enjoy. Be well.
